# Disease-Classification-of-Rice-Plant-Leaves-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-Method
Rice a staple crop for much of the world's population, is vulnerable to leaf diseases that reduce yields. Manual identification of these diseases by farmers is often inefficient and inaccurate due to limited knowledge. Therefore, technology using algorithms is necessary for early disease detection. This study uses the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm with VGG16 architecture and Transfer Learning to classify rice leaf diseases. The research aims to assess the performance of CNN in classifying rice leaf disease images.
